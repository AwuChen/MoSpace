        <h3>Hi there! Thank you for being curious about us! I'm <span class="underline" id="namey">Yiwei</span><img class="portrait" id="portraity" src="team_yiwei.png">, one of the founding members of MoSpace. Between the three of us, <span class="underline" id="namea">Awu</span><img class="portrait" id="portraita" src="team_awu.png"> and I are currently growing our own long-distance relationship (sorry <span class="underline" id="names">Shine</span><img class="portrait" id="portraits" src="team_shine.png">). MoSpace was conceptualized during quarantine as Awu and I struggled to find ways to communicate effectively across an 8-hour time difference.</h3>
        <img class="divider" src="img_temp.png">
        <h3>MoSpace began as moving doodles and images across a shared Google Slides file as part of a <a class="underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtla_S8lXIc" target="_blank">documentary</a> Awu shot. Since then, we've shot down dozens of ideas, had countless meetings and interviews, and have been working our asses off trying to make MoSpace the best it can be; but from the beginning it was clear to us that our goal was to make something that we (and uh, maybe Shine too if he ever gets into an LDR) would use for ourselves.</h3>

        <h3>MoSpace was made to serve those in predicaments similar to ours. When you've got so much to share but your partner is busy or sleeping. To have a place you can come back to when you miss your partner.</h3>
        <img class="divider" src="img_temp.png">
        <h3>As you may have picked up, this wierd trio of friends&mdash;Yiwei and Awu (and Shine)&mdash;make up the team behind MoSpace; our respective fortes being in film, immersive media, and graphic design. Together, we've been creating MoSpace over the past few months. (Photos coming soon!)</h3>

        <h3>In case you're wondering, MoSpace isn't our first rodeo! We've worked on/led a few projects other people also enjoyed (winning a few awards on the way) before we began our journey developing MoSpace. <a class="underline" href="#" target="_blank" style="font-style: italic;">Ama's Momento</a> is a multimedia experience that encapsulated the dreams of Awu's grandmother (<a class="underline" href="https://www.indiecade.com/amas-momento/" target="_blank">IndieCade</a>/<a class="underline" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2019-10-13/indiecade-shows-whats-next-underground-gaming" target="_blank">LA Times</a>). <a class="underline" href="#" target="_blank" style="font-style: italic;">Dear Mom</a> is a VR film we did for Mothers' Day this year depicting the cultural and generational conflicts between a Chinese-American artist and her traditional Chinese mother(<a class="underline" href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/dear-mom-a-mothers-day-virtual-reality-film-about-asian-pacific-immigrants/" target="_blank">Oculus</a>).</h3>
